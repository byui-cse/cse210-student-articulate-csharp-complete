# Dice
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Dice and you might be 
surprised. The rules are simple. Roll the dice. Count the ones and 
fives. Each one is worth 100 and 50 points respectively. As long as 
you roll at least a one or a five you can try again. If not the game 
is over.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open 
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program 
by running the following commands.
```
dotnet build
dotnet run 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on 
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the 
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green 
arrow or "start debugging" button.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
